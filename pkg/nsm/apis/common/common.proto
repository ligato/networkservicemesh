//  ConnectionContext - end to end context for the connection between an NSC and NSE
//  Motivation:
//        Many things like addressing, routing, etc are generally best decided by
//        the NSE.  
//        The NSC however has the best picture of what it needs.
//        Does it need ipv4 addressing on the connection endpoints?
//        Does it need a set of IPv6 prefixes valid in the context of that connection
//        it can use for downstream clients?
//        Are there prefixes that cannot be used in the context of the connection
//        because they are used elsewhere?
//   context - a key value map of context information it can be used to communicate
//             the NSC's needs (partially specified) or the NSEs decisions (fully specified)
//   Known keys - all of these keys are optional
//   context[requires] - comma separated list of keys the NSC needs to get back in the context from the NSE
//                       Example: requires=src_ip,dst_ip, ip_routes
//   context[src_ip] - ip addresses of the source end of the connection
//                         Example src_ip=1.1.1.1/30
//                         Typically provided by NSE, but may be proposed by NSC
//   context[dst_ip] - ip addresses of destination end of the connection, typically provided by NSE, but may be proposed by NSC
//   context[src_mac] - mac address of source end of the connection, typically provided by NSE, but may be proposed by NSC
//   context[dst_mac] - mac address of source end of the connection
//   context[exclude_prefixes] - comma seperated list of ip prefixes, specified by NSC that cannot be used in response by NSE
//   context[ip_routes] - comma seperated list of ip prefixes to be routed to the connection, typically specified by NSE
//   Note: This list will expand and evolve
