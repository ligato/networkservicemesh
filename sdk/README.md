# Network Service Mesh SDK

## General Concepts

The purpose of the SDK is to hide the lower level setup and communication details of Network Service Mesh (NSM). Using it eases the implementation of Network Service Clients and Endpoints. Please refer to the [glossary](../docs/spec/glossary.md) for more detailed explanation of the terminology.

The current SDK targets Golang as the main Client and Endpoint implementation language. Other languages (C/C++, Python) might be considered for the future.

NSM comes with an [admission controller](../docs/spec/admission.md) implementation, which will allow for simple init and sidecar container approach when migrating existing services. This is approach is suitable for simpler solutions like web services, where no advanced interface knowledge is needed.

### The underlying gRPC communication

As noted, the SDK is a higher layer abstraction of the underlying gRPC API.

#### Client gRPC

The client uses a named socket to talk to its local Network Service Manager (NSMgr). The socket is located in ***TBD***. The gRPC itself is described in [networkservice.proto](../controlplane/api/local/networkservice/networkservice.proto).

#### Endpoint gRPC

The endpoint implements a communication over a socket to its local NSMgr. The socket is the same as what the client uses. The gRPC for registering an endpoint is implemented as `service NetworkServiceRegistry` in [registry.proto](../controlplane/api/registry/registry.proto).

## Configuring the SDK

NSM SDK configuration is common for both Client and Endpoint APIs. It is done by setting the values of the following structure:

```go
type NSConfiguration struct {
    NsmServerSocket    string
    NsmClientSocket    string
    Workspace          string
    EndpointNetworkService   string // ENDPOINT_NETWORK_SERVICE
    ClientNetworkService    string // CLIENT_NETWORK_SERVICE
    EndpointLabels string // ENDPOINT_LABELS
    ClientLabels  string // CLIENT_LABELS
    NscInterfaceName   string // NSC_INTERFACE_NAME
    MechanismType      string // MECHANISM_TYPE
    IPAddress          string // IP_ADDRESS
    Routes             []string // ROUTES
}
```

Note that some of the members of this structure can be initialized through the environment variables shown as comments above. A detailed explanation of each configuration option follows:

* `NsmServerSocket` - [ *system* ], NS manager communication socket
* `NsmClientSocket` - [ *system* ], NS manager communication socket
* `Workspace` - [ *system* ], Kubernetes Pod namespace
* `EndpointNetworkService` - [ `ENDPOINT_NETWORK_SERVICE` ], the *Network Service* name that the *Endpoint* implements, as advertised to the NS registry
* `ClientNetworkService` - [ `CLIENT_NETWORK_SERVICE` ], the *Network Service* name, as the *Client* asks for it from the *NSMgr*
* `EndpointLabels` - [ `ENDPOINT_LABELS` ], the *Endpoint* labels, as advertised to the NS registry. Used in *NSMgr* selector to match the DestinationSelector. The format is `label1=value1,label2=value2`
* `ClientLabels` - [ `CLIENT_LABELS` ], the *endpoint* labels, as send by the *client* . Used in *NSMgr* selector to match the SourceSelector. The format is the same as `EndpointLabels`
* `NscInterfaceName` - [ `NSC_INTERFACE_NAME` ], the name off th interface as injected on the client side
* `MechanismType` - [ `MECHANISM_TYPE` ], enforce a particular Mechanism type. Currently `kernel` or `mem`. Defaults to `kernel`
* `IPAddress` - [ `IP_ADDRESS` ], the IP network to initialize a prefix pool in the IPAM composite
* `Routes` - [ `ROUTES` ], list of routes that will be set into connection's context by *Client*

## Implementing a Client

The NSM Client's main task is to request a connection to a particular Network Service through NSM. The NSM SDK provides two API sets for implementing clients.

### Simple Client

The following code snippet illustrates its usage.

```go
import "github.com/networkservicemesh/networkservicemesh/sdk/client"

...

client, err := client.NewNSMClient(context.Background(), nil)
if err != nil {
    // Handle the error
}
// Ensure the client is terminated at the end
defer client.Destroy()

conn, err := client.Connect(context.Background(), "eth101", "kernel", "Primary interface")
// Please pass a proper context object with opentracing for creating a proper span's

// Run the actual code

// Close the current active connection
client.Close(context.Background(), conn)
```

This will create a *client*, configure it using the environment variables as described in `Configuration` and connect a Kernel interface called `eth101`. During the life cycle of the *client*, an arbitrary *Connect* requests can be invoked. The *Destroy* call ensures these are all terminated, if not already done by calling *Close*.

### Client list

The more advanced API call is the client list. It follows the same ***Connect***/***Close***/***Destroy*** pattern as teh simple client. The difference is that it spawns multiple clients which are configured by an env variable `NS_NETWORKSERVICEMESH_IO`. It takes a comma separated list of URLs with the following format:

```shell
${nsname}/${interface}?${label1}=${value1}&${label2}=${value2}
```

A simple example will be:

```shell
NS_NETWORKSERVICEMESH_IO=icmp?app=responder&version=v1,http?app=nginx
```

Invoking the client list API with this environment set will initiate a connection to a service named `icmp` and the connection request will be labelled with `app=responder` and `version=v1`. Additionally a second connection to a service `http` and its request will be labelled `app=nginx`. The [admission hook](../docs/spec/admission.md) leverages this configuration method.

A simplified example code which demonstrates the ClientList usage is shown below.

```go
import "github.com/networkservicemesh/networkservicemesh/sdk/client"

...

client, err := client.NewNSMClientList(context.Background(), nil, nil)
if err != nil {
    // Handle the error
}
// Ensure the client is terminated at the end
defer client.Destroy()

if err := client.Connect(context.Background(), "nsm", "kernel", "Primary interface"); err != nil {
    // Handle the error
}
```

## Creating a Simple Endpoint

The following code implements a simple *endpoint* that upon request will create an empty connection object and assign it a pair of IP addresses.

```go
import "github.com/networkservicemesh/networkservicemesh/sdk/endpoint"

...

composite := endpoint.NewCompositeEndpoint(
	endpoint.NewConnectionEndpoint(nil),
    endpoint.NewIpamEndpoint(nil),
    )

nsmEndpoint, err := endpoint.NewNSMEndpoint(context.Backgroud(), nil, nil, composite)
if err != nil {
    // Handle the error
}

nsmEndpoint.Start()
defer nsmEndpoint.Delete()
```

As there is no explicit configuration, the *ConnectionEndpoint*, *IpamEndpoint* and the composed *nsmEndpoint* are initialized with the matching environment variables.

## Creating an Advanced Endpoint

The NSM SDK Endpoint API enables plugging together different functionalities based on the `CompositeEndpoint` interface. The basic principle is that the `Request` call handlers are chained together in a process called composition. The function call to create such *composite* is `NewCompositeEndpoint(endpoints ...ChainedEndpoint) networkservice.NetworkServiceServer`. Its argument order determines the order of `Request` call chaining. The arguments implement the `networkservice.NetworkServiceServer` interface.

### Writing a endpoint

Writing a new *endpoint* is done by extending the `networkservice.NetworkServiceServer` structure. 

* `Request(context.Context, *NetworkServiceRequest) (*networkservice.Connection, error)` - the request handler. The contract here is that the implementer should call next composite's Request method and should return whatever should be the incoming connection. Example: check the implementation in `sdk/endpoint/monitor.go`.
* `Close(context.Context, *networkservice.Connection) (*empty.Empty, error)` - the close handler. The implementer should ensure that next composite's Close method is called before returning.


In case endpoint need some initialization logic it could implement `endpoint.Initable` interface and method
* `Init(context *InitContext) error` - an init function to be called before the endpoint GRPC listener is started but after the NSM endpoint is created.


### Creating a route mutator endpoint

To create mutator to sets routes for `IPContext` you can use a `enpoint.CreateRouteMutator` function.
Example of usage:
```go
	routeEndpoint := endpoint.NewCustomFuncEndpoint("route",endpoint.CreateRouteMutator([]string{"dst addr"}))
	
```
### Pre-defined composites

The SDK comes with a set of useful *composites*, that can be chained together and as part of more complex scenarios.

#### Basic composites

* `client` - creates a downlink connection, i.e. to the next endpoint. This connection is available through the `endpoint.ClientConnection(ctx)` method.
* `connection` - returns a basic initialized connection, with the configured Mechanism set. Usually used at the "top" of the composite chain.
* `ipam` - receives a connection and assigns it an IP pair from the configure prefix pool.
* `monitor` - adds connection to the monitoring mechanism. Typically would be at the top of the composite chain.
* `dns` - add DNS servers to ConnectionContext available in two flavors:
* * `NewAddDNSConfigs(...networkservice.DNSConfig)` - Adds DNSConfigs to your connectionContext
* * `NewAddDnsConfigDstIp(searchDomains...string)` - Adds DNSConfig using the DstIp from ConnectionContext as the DNS Server IP
* `customfunc` - allows for specifying a custom connection mutator, it also accept ctx.Context to access extra prameters.

#### VPP Agent composites

* `memif-connect` - receives a connection and creates a DataChange (or appends an existing DataChange) with a Memif interface for it. This DataChange and the name of the created interface is available through the `vppagent.Config(ctx)/vppagent.WithConfig(ctx)` methods.
* `client-memif-connect` - receives a downlink(outgoing) connection from the `client` composite's and creates a DataChange with a Memif interface for it. This DataChange and the name of the created interface is available through the `vppagent.Config(ctx)` method.
* `cross-connect` - receives names of created interfaces and creates a DataChange (or appends an existing DataChange) with cross-connect configuration. This DataChange is available through the `vppagent.Config(ctx)` method.
* `acl` - receives a name of created interface and creates a DataChange (or appends an existing DataChange) with ACLs for this interface. This DataChange is available through the `vppagent.Config(ctx)` method.
* `commit` - receives a DataChange and writes it to VPP Agent.
