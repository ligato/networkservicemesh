# Network Service Mesh - Quick Start Guide

This document will help you configure two Vagrant boxes in a Kubernetes cluster with a master and a worker node. You will also deploy the Network Service Mesh components in the cluster.

## Prerequisites

You can find instructions for your operation systems in the links below:

* [CentOS](prereq-centos.md)
* [OSX](prereq-osx.md)
* [Ubuntu](prereq-ubuntu.md)

If you have another Linux distribution or prefer to go with the upstream, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

* [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)
* [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/installation/)
* [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/)
* [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/)

### Getting the Network Service Mesh project

```bash
git clone https://github.com/networkservicemesh/networkservicemesh
cd networkservicemesh
```

## Setup the local Vagrant environment

Then we'll configure a Kubernetes cluster. A master and a worker node will be launched in two separate Vagrant machines. The Network Service Mesh components will then be deployed to the cluster.

Start the Vagrant machines:

```bash
make vagrant-start
```

Ensure your `kubectl` is configured to point to Vagrant's Kubernetes cluster:

```bash
source scripts/vagrant/env.sh
```

## Deploy the core Network Service Mesh components

All commands have been wrapped in make machining tooling.

### Build the Network Service Mesh images and push then to the Vagrant machines

First, let's build the Docker images of the various components of Network Service Mesh:

```bash
make k8s-save
```

Load the images on the Vagrant Machines.

```bash
make k8s-load-images
````

The core Network Service Mesh infrastructure is deployed via Helm with the following command:

```bash
make helm-init
make helm-install-nsm
```

### Verify the services are up and running

The following check should show two `nsmgr`, two `nsm-vpp-forwarder`, and one `nsm-admission-webhook` pod

```bash
kubectl get pods -n nsm-system

NAME                                     READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
nsm-admission-webhook-8597995474-2p7vc   1/1     Running   0          2m4s
nsm-vpp-forwarder-9lfnv                  1/1     Running   0          2m5s
nsm-vpp-forwarder-w424k                  1/1     Running   0          2m5s
nsmgr-5mkr2                              3/3     Running   0          2m5s
nsmgr-gc976                              3/3     Running   0          2m5s
```

This will allow you to see your Network Service Mesh daemonset running:

```bash
kubectl get daemonset nsmgr -n nsm-system


NAME   DESIRED   CURRENT   READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   NODE SELECTOR   AGE
nsmgr   2         2         2       2            2           <none>          19m
```

## Deploy the Monitoring components

```bash
helm-install-nsm-monitoring
```

When deployed successfully two `skydive-agent`, one `skydive-analyzer`, one `crossconnect-monitor` and one `jaeger` pod will be running in the nsm-system namespace.

````bash 
kubectl get pods -n nsm-system 

NAME                                     READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
crossconnect-monitor-57dcf588dd-qk2n9    1/1     Running   0          43s
jaeger-f5d6744c5-t2tc8                   1/1     Running   0          43s
skydive-agent-hr9xh                      1/1     Running   0          43s
skydive-agent-jxmm9                      1/1     Running   0          43s
skydive-analyzer-778fc98897-9cr5w        1/1     Running   0          43s
```

## Deploy the Network Service Mesh examples

Now that we have the NSM infrastructure deployed, we can proceed with deploying some of the examples.

* The basic ICMP example is deployed like this:

```bash
make helm-install-icmp-responder
```

* The VPN service composition example is deployed with:

```bash
make helm-install-vpn
```

## Verify deploying the examples

Both of the examples can be verified by running a simple check:

```bash
make k8s-check
```

* For ICMP you should see ping succeeding as below:

```bash
./scripts/nsc_ping_all.sh
