Proxy NSMgr
============================

Specification
-------------

Proxy NSMgr provides an ability to pass Network Service requests and connection monitoring via any point of network.

 * Current realization of Proxy NSMgr is a part of the implementation of the Interdomain connectivity

Implementation details
---------------------------------

* Proxy NSMgr starts as kubernetes service. All started Proxy NSMgr instances can be reached by a single DNS name "pnsmgr-svc"

* Client ask for a Network Service with a name of the form "network-service@destination-address" to pass all requests through Proxy NSMgr

* NSMgr sends the registry calls to find the NetworkService Endpoints for the Network Service to the Proxy NSMgr.

* Client's NSMgr negotiate the 'remote.Mechanism' with remote domain NSMgr through the proxy NSMgr.

*  Client's NSMgr initiate connection monitoring via proxy NSMgr for the death and healing purposes
